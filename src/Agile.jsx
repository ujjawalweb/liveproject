<Agile_content agiletitle1="The original Agile Manifesto declares agile has four core values:"

agilepara1a="Individuals and interactions over processes & tools."
agilepara1b="Working software over comprehensive documentation."
agilepara1c="Customer collaboration over contract negotiation."
agilepara1d="Responding to change over following a plan."

agilepara1e="These four core values are at the heart of all agile project management approaches. Furthermore, these core values inform everything from working standards to all 12 agile project management principle"

agiletitle2="Principles of agile project management:"

agilepara2="The first priority is customer satisfaction through the early and also continuous deliverables of valuable software. It delivers working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for a short timescale. People in the Business and developers must work together every day throughout the project. Build projects with motivated individuals, give them the support or environment they need, and trust them to complete the job.

An efficient and most effective method of conveying details to and within a team is face-to-face conversation. Working software is the priority measure of progress. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The user, sponsors, and developers should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Continuous attention to technical excellence and best designs enhances agility. Good architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from the self-organizing teams."

agiletitle3="Benefits of agile project management"
agilepara3="The principles of Agile project management have allowed all types of teams to work more iteratively and flexibly. It empowers them to adapt to their project's shifting requirements and deliver faster."

less="Less risk and more adaptability"

lesspara="One of the main benefits of agile methods is the ability to manage changing priorities. With an iterative approach or emphasis on continuous agile feedback, you can get the data needed during the developmental process, not after, allowing the team to make more impactful choices based on actual conditions, not just predicted conditions.
The teams can improve project predictability and reduce risk with designated short sprint cycles, clearer project visibility, and regular reporting updates."


good="Good customer satisfaction"

goodpara="As we know, Customer collaboration is one of the four core values of agile project management. One of the key benefits of this is that with good customer collaborations comes greater customer satisfaction. Agile project management methodologies encourage you to work closely with the customers and other stakeholders to ensure you create something that solves their problems.
And because agile projects incorporate regular testing & review with every sprint, you can get their real-time feedback with each iteration of your working product."
